REGULUS
=======


Regulus is the system I use to store all the miscellaneous
customization, bash-functions and configuration of my system. The aim
is to have a proper version control of all of my configuration files
as well as doing some tidying.

I had the idea when I saw the
[sputnik project](https://http://github.com/sputnik/) started by dell.

The files in this directory are the ones I use, i.e. for instance my
`.emacs` file is just a symbolic link to the one at
`~/regulus/emacs/dot_emacs`. 


Files currently protected by Regulus
====================================

Bash
----

The configuration of my prompt, the miscellaneous custom functions I
use and my aliases.



Emacs configuration
-------------------

My .emacs file and .emacs.d directory. Custom shortcuts, and some custom
functions.
