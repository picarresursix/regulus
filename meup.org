* Project description
The project contains elisp code, literate programmed bash with
org-babel and notes in org-mode format. The only part of the directory
which is not to be maintained directly is the content of the emacs.d.

The templates folder contains plenty of files with items but I don't
want them to show up here.

INCLUDE: el sh org
EXCLUDE: emacs_dot_d templates
